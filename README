Wishbone bus simulation in Linux. The project contains a wishbone bus 
driver, a PCI board driver (that has the wishbone bus on it) and tools
for generating the required firmware (for "faking" stuff like memory 
maps). Included are also two fake wishbone drivers.

I am currently testing this on a QEMU virtual machine (running the 
latest git kernel). The hard disk image has been made using debootstrap.

   Compiling
   ---------

You should just "make". The only external dependency is the kernel
to build against. You can set it in the LINUX environment variable:

	export LINUX=/opt/stuff/kernels/wb-kernel-source

The default is  $(HOME)/linux-for-wbonesim  so you can just make a symlink
to the real place and forget about it.
